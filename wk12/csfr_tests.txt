One observation is that by using a session variable (confirmation), the server can verify that the form submission originated from a legitimate session. This helps prevent CSRF attacks where an attacker tries to forge requests on behalf of a user. The use of a random value for confirmation in the session and form makes it difficult for an attacker to guess or forge valid requests.
